# vtiger-checkduplicates-extension

This is a vtiger extension to check for duplicates. It requires manual changes in the database after installation and is therefore only recommended to be used if familiar with manually changing anything in the vtiger database.

The table ms_duplicatecheck contains the fields that need checking for duplicates and defines what action should happen in case the system found a duplicate.
